/**
 * This release: its version and what is new in it, told from your side of
 * the screen - what is different when you open the app - rather than the
 * code's.
 *
 * ── One version, one place ──
 *
 * It was three numbers for one app: package.json said 0.5.0, What's New said
 * 0.5.0 and the Settings footer said 0.4.0, because each was typed by hand.
 * package.json is the one the crash log already reads, so it is the one:
 * bump it, and What's New, the footer and the changelog all follow.
 *
 * ── Small on purpose ──
 *
 * What's New is on the first screen of the app, so it imports only this.
 * The full history is lib/changelog.js, which only the changelog page loads.
